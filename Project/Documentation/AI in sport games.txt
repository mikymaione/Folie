Characters behaviour:
a) Movement:
-individuals
-realistic
-physical simulation

b) Decision making:
-possible actions: set, receive, pass, attack, block, serve, move
-distinct states: looking at the ball, active, take position, take the ball
-behaviour change: ball position, touch count
-need to look ahead: ball trajectory, touch count

c) tactical and strategic AI:
-characters work together
-characters think for themselves and display a group behaviour

Strategy: serve receive system, offensive system, coverage system, defensive system.
Formation: "4–2", "6–2" and "5–1"


Multi-level AI:
– Higher level: strategic decisions
– Middle level: coordinated motion system (play patterns)
– Lowest level: single unit

Architecture:
Tactical AI: Tactical Analysis > Rule-based system
Decision Making: Rule-based system > Playbook, Physics prediction (team members / ball)
Movement: Playbook > Kinematic steering
Movement: Physics prediction (team members / ball) > Kinematic steering, Rule-based system, Tactical Analysis

Physics prediction: predict trajectory
Playbook: algorithms for making sure that characters move at the correct time; formation motion system

Movement algo. family: kinematic movement:
class Character
class Game
class MovementAlgo
class MovementRequest
movReq = MovementAlgo.elaborate(game, player)
player.move(moveReq);
