Multi-level AI:
– Higher level: strategic decisions
– Middle level: coordinated motion system (play patterns)
– Lowest level: single unit

Architecture:
Tactical AI: Tactical Analysis > Rule-based system
Decision Making: Rule-based system > Playbook, Physics prediction (team members / ball)
Movement: Playbook > Kinematic steering
Movement: Physics prediction (team members / ball) > Kinematic steering, Rule-based system, Tactical Analysis

Physics prediction: predict trajectory
Playbook: algorithms for making sure that characters move at the correct time; formation motion system

Movement algo. family: kinematic movement:
class Character
class Game
class MovementAlgo
class MovementRequest
movReq = MovementAlgo.elaborate(game, player)
player.move(moveReq);
